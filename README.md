# Daphony

This is a proof-of-concept D binding to the
[SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS)
sparse graph processing library.

This uses the [dpp](https://github.com/atilaneves) library to allow C
headers to be directly included into D programs.

See src/main.dpp for an example.
